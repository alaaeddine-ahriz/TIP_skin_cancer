    "\n",
    "This project aims to develop a robust and accurate skin cancer detection system using machine learning and computer vision techniques. By leveraging a dataset of skin lesion images, the system will be trained to classify images into different categories of skin cancer, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment. The project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation to ensure high performance and reliability."
